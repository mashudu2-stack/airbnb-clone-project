# airbnb-clone-project

##  Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend-focused application designed to simulate a booking platform like Airbnb.  
It will help us understand backend development, database design, and API security while building a scalable web application.

## Goals
- Learn GitHub collaboration workflows.
- Practice backend architecture with Django.
- Design and document a relational database using MySQL.
- Implement API security best practices.
- Explore CI/CD automation for deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Django  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **API**: GraphQL & REST  
- **Containerization**: Docker  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
